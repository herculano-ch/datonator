Remember that you assumes to use mysql database

Create a `.env` file in root, with something like this:

```
export MYSQL_USER=root

export MYSQL_DATABASE=datonator_db

```

Than open your terminal `source .env`


  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  
## Database seeds
 
Now you can enter in your console with `iex -S mix` 

Then run an experimental seed, as times as you want, pass this command above: 

`Datonator.create_eligibles`
